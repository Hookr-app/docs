## What is Hookr?

Hookr is a webhook receiver that sends you push notifications directly to your phone. Think of it like a mail carrier who doesn't just deliver your packages—they read what's inside and call you immediately to let you know it arrived.

Instead of building and maintaining your own server to receive webhooks from external services, you create a unique webhook URL in Hookr. When events happen—a payment processes, an order ships, your infrastructure alerts—the service sends an HTTP request to your Hookr URL, and you get an instant 🔔 notification on your iOS or Android device.

Hookr eliminates the gap between webhook sources and the people who need to know about them *right now*.

## How it works

Getting started takes just three steps:

1. **Create a webhook** — Generate a unique HTTPS URL in Hookr that external services can send requests to.

2. **External service sends a request** — Any service that supports webhooks (payment processors, form builders, monitoring tools, etc.) sends an HTTP GET or POST request to your Hookr URL with event data.

3. **You get instant notification** — Hookr receives the request, sends you a push notification on your phone with the event details, and optionally forwards the data to other services (Zapier, Make, or custom APIs).

That's it. No servers to manage, no complex infrastructure—just instant notifications.

## Real-world use cases

### Payment alerts

A payment processor sends a webhook when a transaction completes:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.success",
  "amount": 9999,
  "currency": "USD",
  "customer": "john@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T14:32:00Z"
}
```

Hookr sends you an instant notification: "💳 Payment received: $99.99 from john@example.com"

### Order status updates

Your e-commerce platform notifies you when orders ship:

```json
{
  "event": "order.shipped",
  "order_id": "ORD-12345",
  "tracking_url": "https://carrier.com/track/xyz",
  "customer": "Jane Smith"
}
```

You get: "📦 Order ORD-12345 shipped—Jane Smith can track here."

### Infrastructure monitoring

Your server monitoring tool alerts on critical issues:

```json
{
  "alert": "high_cpu",
  "server": "api-prod-01",
  "cpu_usage": 94.2,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T14:45:00Z"
}
```

Immediate notification: "⚠️ api-prod-01 CPU at 94.2%—take action now."
