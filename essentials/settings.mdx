## Notifications

Use the main toggle to enable or disable all push notifications.

- **On**: Notifications follow your Silent Mode and Active Days settings.
- **Off**: All notifications are suppressed.

### Timezone

Your timezone is displayed for reference and is set automatically from your device. It affects how Silent Mode and Active Days are evaluated.

---

## Silent Mode

Silent Mode lets you set a daily time window where notifications are muted.

- **Start Time** and **End Time** control when silence begins and ends.
- Windows can cross midnight (for example, 22:00 to 08:00).

**Time Sensitive webhooks override Silent Mode.** Learn more in [Time Sensitive Notifications](../features/time-sensitive).

---

## Active Days

Active Days lets you choose which days of the week notifications are allowed.

- Toggle each day on or off.
- Days are ordered based on your device locale.

**Time Sensitive webhooks ignore Active Days.** Learn more in [Time Sensitive Notifications](../features/time-sensitive).

---

## Notification Permissions

If system-level notification permissions are disabled, the notifications toggle becomes unavailable. Follow your device settings to re-enable notifications.

---

## Subscription Management

You can upgrade to Pro or manage your subscription from the Settings screen. The app shows the correct action based on your current plan.

---

## Tips

- Use Silent Mode to reduce noise overnight.
- Use Active Days to mute weekends or non-working days.
- Reserve [Time Sensitive Notifications](../features/time-sensitive) for truly urgent webhooks.
