## Overview

A webhook is a receiver that accepts incoming requests from external services or applications. When a request arrives at your webhook, it automatically sends you a push notification. Your webhook can also:

- Automatically forward the incoming data to external services (Zapier, custom APIs, etc.)
- Create personalized notification messages using information from the request
- Keep sensitive data private on your device only—never store it on Hookr servers
- Control whether notifications interrupt Do Not Disturb mode on iPhone or Focus modes on Android

Think of a webhook as a mailbox that alerts you when something arrives and can forward it wherever you need it to go.

## Webhook Entity

A webhook has several properties that control how it behaves. Here's what each one does:

| Property | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|
| **Title** | The name you give to identify this webhook (e.g., "Daily Report", "Error Alert") |
| **Message** | The text sent in push notifications. You can personalize it using data from your event. |
| **Enabled** | When turned on, the webhook listens for events and sends notifications. When off, it stays silent. |
| **Private** | When enabled, event data stays only on your device—never stored on Hookr servers. Extra privacy. |
| **Time Sensitive** | When enabled on iPhone, notifications break through Do Not Disturb mode to reach you immediately. |
| **Forwarding** | When enabled, event data is automatically sent to external URLs you specify. |
| **Forward URLs** | Up to 3 external services where Hookr will send your event data (e.g., your API, Zapier, webhooks.fun). |
| **Forward Secret** | A security code used to verify that forwarded requests actually come from Hookr. Treat it like a password. |
| **Last Event** | Shows when the webhook last received an event. Helps you know if it's still working. |

## Message Templates

Your notification messages can include personalized data from your events. Instead of static messages, you can create dynamic ones like:

- "Payment of $50 received from John"
- "Error in getUserData function"
- "Order #12345 is now shipped"

See [Message Templates with Handlebars](../features/handlebars) for detailed instructions on how to insert event data into your messages.
