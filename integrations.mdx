## Overview

API keys are used for private integrations with third-party tools like Make and n8n. This private API is not intended for public use without a supported integration. You can use it directly if you understand the implications, but it is designed for trusted workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Download the iOS or Android app
- Log in to your Hookr account

## How to obtain an API key

1. Open the Hookr app.
2. Log in to your account.
3. Navigate to the Settings tab and scroll down to the API Keys section.
4. Press the "Create API Key" button.
5. Tap the API key to copy it.

## Resetting an API key

You can rotate or reset your API key from the same API Keys section. Press "Reset API Key" to generate a new key. Your old key stops working immediately, so update every integration that used the previous key.

## Use cases

**Basic**
- Connect Hookr to Make or n8n to trigger push notifications from your workflows.
- If you self-host n8n, install the Hookr node from npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-hookr-app

**Advanced**
- Use the API key in a private, authenticated automation flow to post sensitive events while keeping the integration scoped to trusted tools.

## Rate limits

Each API key is treated as a single webhook for rate limiting. Push notification invocations made with an API key are limited to 10 requests per minute.
